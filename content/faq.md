# What is League of Items?

League of Items is like [U.GG](https://u.gg) but for items and runes. Instead of pages for champions here you will find
pages for items, on these pages you can see which champions use this item and other relevant information.

# How do I use it?

Say you like playing with Shurelya's Battlesong, but don't know what champions to play it on. On this site you can see
what champions you can play it with.  
You can also see analytics for this item on it's page, if this item is better as first or second item or maybe last.  
Each champion also has its own page, this is more like U.GG, but shows more data. If an item is very good on a champion,
but not build as often, you will not see it on U.GG but you will here.  
Also the high-res item images are pretty neat.

# Where does the data come from?

All data is scraped from [U.GG](https://u.gg). The data analyzed is from Plat+ of all regions.
